# PART 01: Query Generation
# Write a function to accept two strings (username and a password) and return a single string (SQL) representing
# the query used to determine if a user is authenticated on a given system. The query will be similar to one
# presented in the textbook. Provide the code for the function in the report and a couple sentences justifying
# that it works the way one would expect.
#
# Generate a set of cases (one for each member of your team) that represent valid input where the username and the
# password consist of letters, numbers, and underscores. Create a function that feeds these test cases through the
# query function and displays the resulting query. Provide the code in the report, a sample of the output from the
# function, and a couple sentences justifying why the test cases provide adequate coverage of the valid input.

# PART 02: Vulnerabilities
# Generate test cases (again, each team member should generate one test case) that demonstrate a tautology attack.
# Create a function that feeds these test cases through the query function and displays the output. Provide the code,
# output, and justification in the lab report.
#
# Do the same thing for a union query attack, an additional statement attack, and a comment attack. As with tautology,
# each attack must be demonstrated with a separate set of test cases, a separate function feeding the test cases to
# the query function, and justification in the lab report.
